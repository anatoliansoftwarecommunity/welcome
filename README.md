## Who are we?

We are a few people whose programming hobby turns into our professional job and who miss old but good days.

## Why did this community build?

We want to find people like us. In that way, we can share our experience, create opportunities for developing non-profit and fun hobby projects.

Maybe one day our hobby projects can turn into open source projects and be used in many companies or many applications.

## Our Motivation

Written as in [Daniel Pink's Book called Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y); autonomy, mastery, and purpose are some core values to motivate us. These core values became also cattalisor for building community.

### Autonomy

Autonomy is the most important motivation source to allow us to do programming which is our hobby outside of the job. For getting fully motivated, we can control what we do, when we do, and with whom we do.

Autonomy allows us to use our creativity more without having to follow strict rules.

### Mastery

Mastering in programming is another source of motivation. We will use our potential and ability to implement it.

#### Sharing

Sharing is the sub-motivation source to support mastery. Sharing knowledge and experience and also learning new things motivates us.

#### Courage

Courage is essential for mastery. "Courage to make mistakes", "Courage to try", "Courage to express", and similar kinds of courage must-have.

### Purpose

To confess, our main goal is to keep our hobby as a hobby.  Only in this way can we make our life, where we currently work and earn money, more bearable.
