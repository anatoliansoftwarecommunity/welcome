## Who are we?

We are a few people whose programming hobby turn into our professional job and who miss old but good days.

## Why did this community build?

We want to find people like us. In that way we can share our experience, create opportunity for developing non-profit and fun hobby projects.

Maybe one day our hobby projects can turn into open source projects and be used in many companies or many applications.

## Our Motivation

Written as in [Daniel Pink's Book called Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y); autonomy, mastery and purpose are some core values to motivate us. These core values became also cattalisor for building community.

### Autonomy

Autonomy; is the most important motivation source to allow to do programming which is our hobby outside of the job. For getting fully motivated, we are able to control what we do, when we do and with whom we do.

Autonomy;  it allows us to use our creativity more without having to follow strict rules.

### Mastery

Mastering in programming is another source of motivation. We will use our potential and ability of implement it.

#### Sharing

Sharing is the sub motivation source to support mastery. To share knowledge and experience and also learning new things motivates us. 

#### Courage

Courage is essential for mastery. "Courage to make mistake", "Courage to try", "Courage to express" and similar kind of courage must we have.

### Purpose

To confess, our main goal is to keep our hobby as a hobby.  Only in this way can we make our life, where we currently work and earn money, more bearable.
