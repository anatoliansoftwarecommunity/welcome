# Project Rules

Every project must have a repository with the following folder structure.

```txt
.
+-- docs
      +-- REFERENCE.md
      +-- ...
+-- src
      +-- ...
+-- .git
      +-- ...
+-- .gitignore
+-- LICENSE
+-- README.md
```

`docs` folder includes all required information such as installation guide, developer, and end-user documents. This folder must contain `REFERENCE.md` for keeping cited, inspired by, or solutions links.

`src` folder includes all developed codes (also tests) and required 3rd party libraries.

## Project Names

There is not any restriction about the project name. The project name will select with open votes in the community.
